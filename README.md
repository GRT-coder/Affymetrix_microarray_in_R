# Analysis of Expression profiling by array

Demostration of microarray basic analysis with R.

Gene expression profiling of skin from 6 patients treated with isotretinoin was performed to gain insights into its mechanism of action. Skin biopsies were obtained from the patients at baseline and at one-week isotretinoin treatment.
